### Blu Moon bot legal information
As the creator of the Blu Moon bot, I want to be transparent with the community. I'm not a legal expert, nor do I have extensive knowledge in creating Privacy Policies or Terms of Service. However, Discord requires bots to provide these documents to ensure that users are informed about how their data is handled and the rules governing the use of the bot.
